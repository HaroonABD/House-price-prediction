Predicting house prices using Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor
In this project, I used regression algorithms to build a model that could learn patterns and relationships within a dataset containing various attributes such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other key factors influencing house prices. Employing Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn, I preprocessed the data, handled missing values, and performed feature scaling to ensure accurate predictions.

To evaluate the model's performance, I implemented the Train-Test Split technique, which involves dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets. This approach allowed me to train the model on one portion of the data and assess its predictive capabilities on unseen data, thus gauging its ability to generalize well to new instances.

Throughout the project, I fine-tuned the model's hyperparameters, performed feature selection to enhance model efficiency, and addressed potential issues like overfitting. Additionally, I visualized the results and model insights, contributing to a better understanding of the relationships between features and house prices.
